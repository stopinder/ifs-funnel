      <p>
        Over the years, my work has evolved. What began as talking therapy has become something quieter —
        an inquiry into attention itself. The following reflection captures the essence of that shift.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-300 mt-10">
        🌾 Why Talking Therapy No Longer Works the Way We Think It Does
      </h3>
      <p>
        After years of sitting in the room — IFS, Gestalt, person-centred, somatic — I began to notice a quiet pattern.
        The longer we talk about our experience, the further we drift from it.
        Insight piles upon insight, but the body grows no lighter.
      </p>
      <p>
        It isn’t that therapy fails; it’s that talk alone can’t carry consciousness all the way home.
        Words can open the door, but eventually they keep us at its threshold — describing the view instead of walking through it.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-300 mt-10">
        🌿 The Real Work Is Attention
      </h3>
      <p>
        Everything depends on the quality of attention we bring to our own life.
        Attention is the first movement of love — how we meet experience before we interpret it.
        When attention becomes coherent, the nervous system regulates, thought quiets, and emotion finds its natural pulse.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-300 mt-10">
        🍂 From Parts Work to Wholeness Work
      </h3>
      <p>
        I still draw on Internal Family Systems — but as a short, catalytic process, not a lifelong excavation.
        A few conversations can reveal the architecture of the inner world: the critic, the controller, the weary child, the rescuer.
        Once they’re seen, the aim is not to catalogue them endlessly but to listen through them.
      </p>
      <p>
        IFS becomes the doorway, not the dwelling. The true movement is from working on parts to living from the wholeness that already holds them.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-300 mt-10">
        🌬️ Beyond the Orbit of Insight
      </h3>
      <p>
        Many long-term therapies become orbiting systems — self-study as self-maintenance.
        The next phase of inner work isn’t more dialogue; it’s deeper coherence. Less narrative, more embodiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Body provides gravity and ground. Emotion offers movement and warmth. Thinking lends clarity and direction.
        When these harmonize, awareness becomes fertile again.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-300 mt-10">
        🌾 How We Might Work Together
      </h3>
      <p>
        My work now is brief, integrative, and alive — a meeting or two, perhaps a small arc of sessions,
        focused on helping you realign attention itself. Together we might clarify which parts still over-function or over-guard,
        notice where thought overrides sensation, and re-tune attention so that the whole system can breathe again.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-300 mt-10">
        🌼 Who This Work Is For
      </h3>
      <p>
        This approach tends to resonate with clinicians, healers, and long-term seekers who feel therapy has taken them as far as it can;
        people fluent in self-awareness, yet still tired or subtly disembodied;
        those drawn toward simplicity, honesty, and direct experience.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-purple-300 mt-10">
        🌾 A Closing Thought
      </h3>
      <p>
        Therapy was the bridge that carried us from unconscious pattern to conscious participation.
        But bridges are meant to be crossed. Beyond the bridge lies the practice of attention itself —
        the living synthesis of body, feeling, and thought in real time.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t have to keep orbiting your story.
        You can return to gravity, to ground, to breath.
        Healing begins when talking ends and attention begins.
      </p>
